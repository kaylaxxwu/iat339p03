  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a research-driven UX designer with curiosity. Whether it's graphic design or product design, 
    I always question why a design is made in a particular way. Because I like the UX design approach, 
    which involves problem-solving through research and user-centered design, 
    I moved from the graphic design profession to UX. I employ UX research strategies 
    like survey and co-creation workshop to identify user problems and needs, and 
    then design the experience to fulfill their needs. When creating user interface design, I combine my 
    graphic design skills with tools like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Figma to create visually appealing designs with the right visual hierarchy.</p>
